Description: NVIDIA MIG Partition Editor and Systemd Service
 The NVIDIA MIG Partition Editor allows administrators to declaratively define a
 set of possible MIG configurations they would like applied to all GPUs on a
 node. At runtime, they then point nvidia-mig-parted at one of these
 configurations, and nvidia-mig-parted takes care of applying it. In this way,
 the same configuration file can be spread across all nodes in a cluster, and a
 runtime flag (or environment variable) can be used to decide which of these
 configurations to actually apply to a node at any given time.
 .
 The nvidia-mig-manager.service is a systemd service and a set of support hooks
 that extend nvidia-mig-parted to provide additional features.
